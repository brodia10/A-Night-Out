Ok i will go only for a little bit

Fast forward to Night time around 7:30pm. Jakes best friend Scott is honking outside.

Jakes grabs his keys and waves out his window to signal that he is coming shortly.

Jake Gets into Scotts car with a look of regret on his face and notices that he brought two other friends i didn't know with him and they are passing a joint around.

Scott notices Jake face of regret and Says “Come on jake, tonight we are going to have fun cheer up buttercup” That seemed to Comfort jake for the time being.

Jake and friends arrive at party to find that there is about 15 people there as we got there kinda early.

Party montage of people drinking and having a blast.

Time is now 8:30 and Jake notices a cute girl[BETHANY] in the corner of the room just drinking only water and observing people. When Suddenly they lock eyes Jake can’t look away and neither can the cute girl. [Bethany]

Jakes bestfriend Scott also sees this and being the great wingman Scott is he swhoops in and tries to introduce both of us. But the introduction becomes awkward because of how drunk he is. Bethany seems to have recognized me and knows my name already.

Scott says to the cute girl “Do you plan on staying here for awhile longer?”

Bethany looks at jake and says
“Well actually I plan on going to this cool abandoned building with my friends you should come”. She seems interested in Jake.

Both Jake and Scott look at each other to decide if they wanna go.
